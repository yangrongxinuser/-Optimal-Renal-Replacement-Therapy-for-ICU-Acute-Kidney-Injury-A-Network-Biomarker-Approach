## Introduction

This project aims to optimize renal replacement therapy for ICU patients with acute kidney injury using network biomarkers. We employ a combination of autoencoders, traditional graph feature engineering techniques, and a novel network biomarker construction method to identify key biomarkers and enhance decision-making.
